Version 3.0 Notes
-----------------

This library has been around for years as version 1 and 2.  However these old versions don't
support the latest Doctrine libraries.  Version 3 does not try to maintain backwards compatibility
with the old versions of this library.  However, this author dropped it into the
[LDOG Stack](https://ldog.apiskeletons.dev)
and it worked without modification.  Version 3 supports DBAL ^4.0 and ORM ^3.0.


Installation
------------

Via composer:

```bash
composer require laravel-doctrine/orm ^3.0.0
```

Because of the auto package discovery feature Laravel has, the ServiceProvider and Facades 
are automatically registered.

To publish the config use:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="config" --provider="LaravelDoctrine\ORM\DoctrineServiceProvider"
```
