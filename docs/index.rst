Introduction
============

Doctrine ORM is an object-relational mapper for PHP that provides
transparent persistence for PHP objects.
Doctrine uses the `data-mapper pattern <https://tsh.io/blog/active-record-vs-data-mapper-patterns-in-php/>`_,
aiming for a complete separation of your domain and business logic
from the persistence in a relational database management system.

The benefit of Doctrine for the programmer is the ability to focus on the
object-oriented business logic and worry about persistence only as a
secondary problem. This doesnâ€™t mean persistence is downplayed by Doctrine ORM.
However, it is our belief that there are considerable benefits for
object-oriented programming if persistence and entities are seperate.
